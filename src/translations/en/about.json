    "about": "About me",
    "content": "My name is Maksim, and a while ago I decided to change the course of my life by entering the fascinating world of web development, after years of working in the hospitality industry. During my time in hospitality, I acquired valuable skills such as meticulous attention to detail, effective communication, and the ability to solve problems under pressure. These learnings not only shaped me as a professional, but also taught me the importance of human relations, empathy, and adaptability – qualities that I now apply in my new career. Today, I find myself in a new stage of my life, exploring and diving deep into the vast and exciting world of web development through my intensive training at Ironhack Bootcamp. My previous experience in hospitality has given me unique insight into the importance of teamwork, creativity to deliver innovative solutions, and dedication to ensuring a quality experience – skills that I continue to hone in software development. I am a full stack developer passionate about creating technological solutions that are both functional and visually appealing. My training at Ironhack allowed me to dive into cutting-edge technologies and master both the frontend and backend, and at 42 Barcelona I continue to delve deeper into topics such as C, C++, Linux systems, and relational databases. Each new challenge and project motivates me to keep learning, as I seek to integrate the best of both worlds: technology and attention to detail. I feel fortunate to be able to combine my passion for web development with my dedication to customer service, creating exceptional digital experiences. As I move forward in this new chapter, I am excited to collaborate on innovative projects and contribute to a future full of possibilities. Thank you for taking the time to learn a little more about my journey. I look forward to sharing more with you in the future, as this path has only just begun."
