    "description": "I'm Maksim, a passionate tech and development guy with a constantly evolving story. After graduating from Ironhack a year ago, where I completed an intensive web development bootcamp, I decided to continue my learning at 42 Barcelona. Here, I dive deep into advanced concepts such as C, C++, Linux systems, and relational databases. At 42, I've not only learned about programming, but I've also dived into handling the shell environment, developing my command-line skills and delving into the most fundamental development environments for programming.In addition to my focus on these technical areas, I continue to maintain and practice both the frontend and backend with JavaScript, and I find myself taking additional courses in software quality (QA) to improve my testing skills and ensure I deliver robust code. Throughout my career, I've always sought to stay on top of the latest technologies, collaborate on projects, and apply my knowledge in different contexts. My passion for learning and my desire to apply what I have learned drives me to continue growing every day. I am excited about the opportunities the future holds for me in the development world.",
